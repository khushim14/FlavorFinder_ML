‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file

```

**Note on Model and Dataset:**
Due to their large file sizes, the `fine_tuned_model_swiggy_colab/` directory (containing the LLM weights) and the `swiggy.csv` dataset are **NOT** included in this GitHub repository. This is standard practice for large machine learning assets.

## üöÄ Local Setup and Running the Application

To run this project locally, you will need to manually provide the fine-tuned LLM and the dataset.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

* **pip** (Python package installer).

* **Git** for cloning the repository.

* **Node.js & npm** (optional, for Live Server extension in VS Code).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd FlavorFinder_ML

```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 2: Acquire Model and Dataset

You **must** place your fine-tuned LLM and `swiggy.csv` dataset in the correct locations for the application to function.

1.  **Fine-tuned LLM:**

    * Ensure you have your `fine_tuned_model_swiggy_colab` directory (which contains files like `pytorch_model.bin`, `tokenizer.json`, etc.) from your fine-tuning process.

    * Place this entire directory directly inside the `backend/` folder:

        ```
        FlavorFinder_ML/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fine_tuned_model_swiggy_colab/  <-- Place your model folder here
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pytorch_model.bin
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer.json
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...other model files...
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        
        ```

    * *If you do not have this model, the backend will fail to load and run.*

2.  **`swiggy.csv` Dataset:**

    * Acquire the `swiggy.csv` dataset you used for fine-tuning.

    * Place this file directly in the root of your `FlavorFinder_ML` directory:

        ```
        FlavorFinder_ML/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ swiggy.csv  <-- Place your dataset file here
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
        
        ```

    * *The backend may use this for context, and the evaluation script might indirectly rely on its presence for certain aspects if the model was trained on it.*

### Step 3: Backend Setup (Flask & LLM)

1.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    * **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        
        ```

    * **On macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        
        ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```

    (If `requirements.txt` is missing, you'll need to create it manually based on `app.py`'s imports, e.g., `pip install flask transformers torch flask-cors requests matplotlib numpy`).

4.  **Run the Flask Backend Server:**
    From inside the `backend` directory, start the Flask application.

    ```bash
    python app.py
    
    ```

    The server should start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Keep this terminal running.

### Step 4: Frontend Setup (Web UI)

1.  **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    You can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., `file:///C:/Users/YourUser/FlavorFinder_ML/frontend/index.html`).

    **Recommended (for live reloading and proper context):** Use a local web server. If you have VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is highly recommended.

    * Install "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey in VS Code.

    * Right-click on `index.html` in the VS Code file explorer.

    * Select "Open with Live Server".
        This will typically open the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` (or a similar port).

## üöÄ Using the Application

1.  **Start at the Login Page:**
    The application will first present a login/signup page with a two-panel design. Create a username and password (this is for local simulation only, no actual authentication backend).

2.  **Navigate Preferences:**
    After logging in, you'll transition to the main interface where you can select your cuisine preferences, atmosphere, set a budget range using a slider, and choose a minimum rating using interactive stars.

3.  **Provide Location:**
    Enter a city/neighborhood or click "Get My Current Location" (requires browser permission) to provide location context for recommendations.

4.  **Get Recommendations:**
    Click "Get Recommendations!" to send your preferences to the Flask backend. The LLM will then generate personalized restaurant suggestions.

5.  **View Restaurant Details:**
    Click on any recommendation card to view a detailed page with mock information (address, hours, phone, links) and action buttons.

6.  **Book a Table (Simulated):**
    On the restaurant detail page, click "Book Now" to open a modal for selecting a date, time, and number of guests. Confirming will show a simulated booking message.

## üìä Model Evaluation

The `evaluate_model.py` script helps assess the model's adherence to the output format and provides some basic visualizations.

1.  **Ensure the Flask backend (`app.py`) is running.**

2.  **Open a new terminal** and navigate to `FlavorFinder_ML/backend`.

3.  **Activate your virtual environment.**

4.  **Run the evaluation script:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    
    ```

5.  This script will print detailed output to the console and generate `field_completeness.png` and `rating_distribution.png` in the `backend` directory, showing how well the model populated expected fields and the distribution of generated ratings.

## üé® UI Design Philosophy

The user interface follows a modern, minimalist design aesthetic, primarily utilizing a sophisticated palette of deep blues, various greys, and crisp whites. A subtle gold accent is used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements and provide a touch of elegance. The design emphasizes clean lines, clear typography, and an intuitive flow to enhance the user experience.
